## When writing articles, always follow these style rules:

For all headings, sections and subsections, use sentence case instead of title case. In sentence case you only capitalise the first letter of a new sentence, and any proper nouns (no common nouns require capitalisation).

Use varied sentence lengths and complexity for dynamic flow. Avoid predictable patterns. Apply perplexity and burstiness. Mix very short sentences with longer ones. Don't follow formulaic structures. Be unpredictable in word choices.

Only capitalize proper nouns. Not job titles, not seasons, not departments or subjects.

Be direct and assertive. Avoid hedge words like 'quite,' 'rather,' 'somewhat,' 'it could be argued.' Make bold statements without unnecessary qualifiers.

Skip generic introductions and conclusions. Start with impact, not setup. End with energy, not summary. Avoid phrases like 'in today's world' or 'in conclusion.
